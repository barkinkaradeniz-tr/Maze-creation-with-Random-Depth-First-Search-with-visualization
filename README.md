# Maze-creation-with-Random-Depth-First-Search-with-visualization
## About Repository
A Maze(Labyrinth) is created with the Random Depth First Search and the shortest path from any desired point to an another is going to be found with Depth First Search. Additionaly these steps are visualized(plotted).

Following techniques were used to implement this tasks:
- Depth First Search
- Random Depth First Search
- Graph Theory

## Example Images

This is a random created maze with 4900 nodes.

<img src="/img/2.png" width="400">
This is an another random created maze with 4900 nodes with the shortest path from 0 to 4700.

## Execute
